# (100 points) A code file SI507project_tests.py which includes a test suite with
# Reasonable tests for the code in SI507project_tools.py
# Tests for any other functionality you want to include that isn't included yet (the tests DO NOT have to pass right now, and maybe shouldn't! They just have to be written for TDD use)
# Does not have to be A LOT of tests, whatever that means to you, just enough to check that functions/class methods/etc will work properly, whether or not they do now.
# A good way to judge is to make sure you have at least eight individual test methods themselves, or are testing at least four or five 'things' (sentences that are descriptions of something to test). Most test suites of this nature, at this scale, would normally be much more than 8 test methods, so this is not a lot to do comparatively!

#IMPORTANT INFO: Not sure about the code yet but I will be testing the following:
#test if csv has 202 number of rows.
#test if type of response is a correct type.
#test if % is in any csv data for countries population table.
#test if continent csv has right number of states.
