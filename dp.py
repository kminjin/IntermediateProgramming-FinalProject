## Routes

@app.route('/')
def home():
    pass # With the db populated, can develop routes that query the db, or even add to it/change it...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    db.create_all() # This will create database in current directory, as set up, if it doesn't exist, but won't overwrite if you restart - so no worries about that
    # IMPORTANT: Only run main_populate if the population of the db is necessary -- becasue it takes a while! If it's already been done, and .db/sqlite file exists, comment it out. This is somethign that would need to be clarified very clearly in a README.
    # TODO a neater way of handling this (an example of future work that may not be worth time in a few short weeks if this is brand new stuff)
    main_populate("Final_dataset.csv") # Or whatever filename
    app.run() # run with this: python main_app.py runserver
